## Step 4

I used the command `ssh sal075@ieng6.ucsd.edu <enter>` to log in to my ieng6 account. The `ssh` command establishes a remote connection to a remote computer instead of my own, `sal075@ieng6.ucsd.edu` is the account name (or my email address), and the `<enter>` command runs the command.

I used the command `git clone git@github.com:sli051357/cse15l-lab7.git <enter>` to clone the correct repository to my workspace. `git clone` copies the contents of the `cse15l-lab7` repository to the SSH workspace, while `git@github.com:sli051357/cse15l-lab7.git` is the `SSH` URL of the forked repository. The `<enter>` command then runs the command.

## Step 6

I first used the command `cd cse15l-lab7 <enter>` to enter the `cse15l-lab7` directory that I had just cloned. I then used the `ls <enter>` command to see what files were available in the directory, which included `test.sh`, or the bash script that I needed to run to run the tests. Then, I used `bash test.sh <enter>` to run the test itself, which gave me the output that told me there were errors.

`:42` jumps to line 42

`l * 5 jumps to character`

`x` deletes character

`i` goes into insert mode

`2` replaces character
`esc` goes back into normal mode
`:wq` quits and saves file

up * 3, enter

git add ListExamples.java
git commit -- vim `i` and then changed ListExamples.java and then `esc` `:wq`
git push
